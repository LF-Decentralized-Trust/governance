1. **Mission and Scope of the LF Decentralized Trust.**
    1. The purpose of the Directed Fund is to enable development of platforms, libraries, tools and solutions, for decentralized systems and applications using blockchain, distributed ledger, and related technologies (collectively, “Decentralized Technologies”) and to raise, budget and spend funds in support of various open source, open data and/or open standards projects relating to Decentralized Technologies, including infrastructure and support initiatives related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”). The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project. Specific goals of the Directed Fund include:

        1. Fostering a global community of enterprise developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs dedicated to advancing open-source software and/or open standards for decentralized systems and applications. This includes platforms, libraries, tools, and applications for blockchain, distributed ledger technologies, decentralized identity systems, tokenized assets and other emerging decentralized models.

        1. Hosting a robust and neutral technical infrastructure: Maintain and enhance a collaborative environment for project development, community events, and educational initiatives. Serve as a neutral, trusted host for community infrastructure, facilitating open discussions and shared resource management.

        1. Driving the broad adoption of decentralized technologies across various industries by cultivating a comprehensive ecosystem of contributors, service providers and end- users.

        1. Promoting decentralized technologies through advocacy and strategic alliances: Engage in active marketing, education, and outreach to demonstrate the benefits and potential of decentralized technologies. Work in partnership with other organizations and aligned entities to promote standards, ensure interoperability, and encourage ethical practices in technology use.

    1. The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status.

    1. The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have an Outreach Committee, a Technical Advisory Council, and other working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be established by the Governing Board. These committees report to the Governing Board.

1. **Membership.**

    1. The Directed Fund will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members (each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as a member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of the LF.
