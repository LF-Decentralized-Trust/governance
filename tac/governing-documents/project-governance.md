This document outlines consistent approaches to certain aspects of running and maintaining an LFDT project.

LFDT projects will always have their own approaches to how they manage and govern themselves, how they
communicate and collaborate, and how they track and communicate progress.

The LFDT sets out `MUST` and `SHOULD DO` behaviours that projects should treat accordingly. This document
is not intended to replace any of the existing governance rules set out by the LFDT. Instead it is designed improve
consistency across projects such that inter-project collaboration is easier, and to make it easier for individuals to
collaborate to multiple LFDT projects.

## Areas of consistency

### Communication

### Bug tracking

### Release planning

### Release communication

### Technical discussion that contributes to project direction

 - Where is discussion, context and background that helps understand story prioritization and the current roadmap
 - 

### Feature/story tracking

 - How well can someone "external" to the project easily follow what the community is currently working on
 - Can people easily identify the priorities of the project, for this release and the next release?
 - Where is this information stored - github wiki, atlassian wiki, github issues

### Roadmap

 - How can I see what the current roadmap is for a project?
 - 

### Issue templates

### Security

 - CVE reporting
 - Maintainer/GH access control
 - GH branch protection rules (e.g. number of approvals)

## Areas that we do not feel require clear consistency between projects

 - Release process i.e. the buttons that are pushed and GHAs that are run to make a release happen
