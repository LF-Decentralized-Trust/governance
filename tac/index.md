# LF Decentralized Trust TAC

This is the website of the LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT) Technical Advisory
Council (TAC). The LFDT TAC is responsible for facilitating communication
and collaboration amongst the LFDT technical communities, including approving
new proposals for project lifecycle changes, establishing community norms,
workflows, or policies that are not within the scope of any single project,
and resolving technical matters that affect multiple projects.
