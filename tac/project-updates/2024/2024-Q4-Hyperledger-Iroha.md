# Project Health

In the past quarter, Iroha 2 has made solid progress. The Iroha 2  team has released a pre-MVP version which is [RC 22.2](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/releases/tag/v2.0.0-pre-rc.22.2), and have been focusing on improving performance, refining the API, and updating SDKs and documentation. We're gearing up to release the MVP in the coming weeks, which will feature SDKs for [Java](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha-java) and [Python](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha-python); a [JavaScript/TS](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha-javascript) SDK will follow in a later release.

Additionally, the Iroha 2 team has finished developing the Iroha 2 [Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha2-block-explorer-web). The MVP is now in great shape and ready for use.

We also successfully moved Iroha 2’s codebase to its [own organization](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha) as part of the transition from the Hyperledger Foundation to the Linux Foundation’s Decentralized Trust initiative.

The Iroha 2 community is active and growing, with lots of interest from potential users and contributors. Questions are being answered regularly, five issues were assigned to the maintainers among community members, and the PRs for these have been merged since the last update. Project updates are being sent every two weeks to keep everyone connected and informed.

Summary of Activities in the Last Quarter related to Community management

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Iroha 2 has been actively engaging with the community through various channels, including Telegram and Discord, where we assist with technical questions, gather feedback, and provide technical guidance. 

The team also hosts a weekly open [community call](https://meet.jit.si/Iroha_biweekly), where we share the latest updates and address questions from community members. Additionally, Iroha 2 sends out a regular newsletter to the [Hyperledger mailing list](https://lists.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/g/iroha), keeping everyone informed on the latest development updates and releases. All while ensuring that communication follows our [code of conduct](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/code-of-conduct.html).
The video recordings of the community calls are uploaded into LF wiki and are available for the community: https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/iroha/pages/21012606/Community+meetings

# Current Plans

* Release the MVP and ensure all SDKs are functioning properly.  
* Iroha 2 has a well-maintained development roadmap for the post-MVP phase. High-priority items include:  
  * Network scalability  
  * Network performance and optimization  
  * Further development and enhancement of user-facing technical documentation

# Maintainer Diversity

Since the last update, the composition of the Iroha 2 maintainers has changed significantly. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to the [Maintainers list](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

Iroha Team acquired 3 new members. Dmitri Murzin has joined the team as a Rust developer, while Mykhailo Lohachov, who initially contributed to the project as a community contributor, has now joined the team as a Rust development intern. In addition, Alexandra Zorina, a Technical Writer, joined the team. 
Also, Nurzhan, a Community manager, along with Roman, a Rust Developer, have left the team.


# Contributor Diversity

Most contributions in the past quarter were made by the core maintainers, with sporadic contributions by community members.

Recently, we launched [a call for contributors](https://www.iroha.tech/contribute) which should hopefully bring some attention to Iroha and motivate folks to join the project.
