# ToIP 2024 Annual Report

[Trust Over IP](https://trustoverip.org/) (ToIP) is a Joint Development Foundation (JDF) project that was founded as a standalone LF project in May 2020 and joined the LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT) umbrella in October 2024. 

Since we are an emerging standards project, we do not (as a general rule) manage open source projects. Instead our Working Groups develop specifications, governance models, and guides for decentralized digital trust infrastructure based on an overall architectural model we call the ToIP stack.

For general information about the ToIP stack, we recommend the following foundational documents produced in our first three years:

* [The ToIP Model](https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/) (a visual guide)  
* [Introduction to ToIP](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf)   
* [Design Principles for the ToIP Stack](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf)   
* [ToIP Technology Architecture Specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/TechArch/) 

In 2024, this is a list of our active Working Groups (and their acronyms):

1. Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)  
2. Technology Stack Working Group (TSWG)  
3. Ecosystem & Governance Working Group (EGWG)  
4. KERI Suite Working Group (KSWG)  
5. Data Modeling and Representation Working Group (DMRWG)  
6. Concepts and Terminology Working Group (CTWG)

For a 2024 status report from each of these WGs, see this [Google Slides deck from our final 2024 All-Members meeting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m8lUl8xWdkk_YVIz_FBjh7nFyFbb8T6NchU2Z2q83Q8/edit?usp=sharing) focused on Working Group Updates.

Note: this was the last All-Members meeting at which we had our own independent Executive Director, Judith Fleenor. After this meeting, we officially joined LFDT and began working with the LFDT staff.
