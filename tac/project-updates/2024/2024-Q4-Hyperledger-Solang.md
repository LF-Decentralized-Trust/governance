# 2024 Q4 Hyperledger Solang

## Project Health

* Hyperledger Solang development is going well, with the main focus on the Soroban target.

* Maintainers Sean Young and Salaheldin met at [Stellar's Meridian 2024 conference](https://meridian.stellar.org/), where Salaheldin gave a talk on Solang. The conference was a great opportunity to attract new contributors to the project.

* Solang Playground Deliverables to the Web3 Foundation were completed and delivered, making the playground closer to the final version.

## Questions/Issues for the TAC

There are no issues at this time.

## Releases

* Cross contract calls and value transfers are not yet merged into the Solang's main, but a release will be made once they are.

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

### For Solang

* Worked on cross-contract calls and value transfers for Soroban target.

* Worked on [Soroban's auth framework](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046-11.md), which is to be demonstrated at the end of Q1 2025. 

* Worked on new Solidity builtins for Soroban target.

* Worked on Soroban's more complex data types (i128, addresses, etc.).

* Complete Soroban's auth framework.
