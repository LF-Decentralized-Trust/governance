1. Bevel has received no external contributions; nearly all contributions during this Q4 have come from the Accenture team. Accenture has stopped maintaining the project actively, project is currently maintained through individual maintainer contributions.
2. Community engagement and interest continue to thrive, as reflected in discussions and inquiries on the Discord channel.
3. Bevel is being currently used/proposed as deployment automation framework for multiple banking and manufacturing organisations's blockchain projects.
4. As a result of the above there could be possible contributions, provided that the orgs agrees to open source code enhancements done on Bevel.
