# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The major highlights have been detailed at the beginning of the report. In summary, there has been a lot of activity in the project. New community members continue to discover the project and make contributions. This quarter we have continued to see contribution and activities from outside the set of the original maintainers. A new Cardano Connector has been developed by an external party who did a great demo during the last community call. They are looking at contributing the connector into the LFDT.

# Current Plans

As part of our annual report, we listed the following goals for 2024.

- Release FireFly v1.3 (Q1) - This has been completed in Q2 2024.
- Host another in-depth workshop to get even more developers hands on with FireFly - An in-depth workshop is being planned and scheduled for 2025.
- Continue to increase diversity of maintainers - No new maintainers this quarter however FireFly has added three 3 new maintainers across 2 organizations since the beginning of the year.

# Maintainer Diversity

FireFly now has 14 maintainers representing three different companies:

- [Kaleido](https://kaleido.io/)
- [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/)
- [OneOf](https://www.oneof.com/)

It is worth noting that each company has at least one maintainer who is a subject matter expert on one or more specific blockchain connectors, and the most foundational parts of the FireFly technology stack.

A list of all maintainers for Hyperledger FireFly may be found [here](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/FIR/Maintainers).

# Contributor Diversity

This past quarter we have seen a decrease in activity as the code base has continued to mature.
