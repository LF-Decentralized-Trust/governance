# 2026 Annual Review Cacti

## Project Health

- Overall, the project is progressing in its mission and fulfilling its goals, despite meeting with some setbacks
- Specifically, we lost Accenture as a maintainer, and Fujitsu's and IBM's contributions have diminished as their maintainers have other commitments.
- The bright light in the project is the increased commitment by Blockdaemon, from whom we added two new mainainers, André Augusto and Carlos Amaro, in addition to Rafael Belchior.
- Thanks primarily to the Blockdaemon maintainers, Cacti continues to be the leading implementor and adopter of the IETF's Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) interoperability standard.
- We successfully concluded a mentorship project where we made more progress on the Cactus-Weaver intgeration, and conducted a workshop in November 2025 showcasing the recent SATP-related developments in Cacti.
- We are generally active on Discord, interacting with the LFDT and open-source community. Some maintainers continue to be key shapers of DLT interoperability standards by participating in the IETF's SATP working group.
- We faced technical issues pushing new full releases because of the move from the `hyperledger` to the `hyperledger-cacti` organization, but we have identified the reasons and are actively engaged in pushing a v3 release. Instead, we pushed a separate beta release just for the SATP-related packages and examples.

## Maintainer Diversity

- We have **6 maintainers** at present from 3 different organizations: (Técnico Lisboa)/Blockdaemon, Fujitsu, IBM. (We had maintainers from Accenture until May 2025).
- The number of active maintainers has **decreased** from 8 to 6.
- The number of maintaining organizations has **decreased** from 4 to 3.
