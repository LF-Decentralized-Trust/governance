# Annual Report Web3j

## Project Health

LF Decentralized Trust Web3j [LFX Insights Dashboard](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=web3j)

The project has almost two years since it became part of the LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem. It was migrated to Hyperledger Foundation from Web3 Labs organization at the beginning of 2024.
Over the past year, we have seen several new contributors and the similar evidence of Web3j usage by other companies, as in 2024, with one new company, Noise.xyz. 
Contributors are joining the Web3j Contributors happens every 2 weeks, [calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/lf-decentralized-trust?view=month).
There is also Discord activity.

Highlights from the 2025 Insights report:
- 66 contributors 
- 651 commits 
- 76% of code activities were performed by one organization (Web3 Labs), an increase of 4% compared to last year
- Total of 50 contributors contributed, which indicates that there are many contributors and organizations with an interest in Web3j.

## Maintainer Diversity

At the moment there are only 3 active maintainers (all from Web3 Labs).

The MAINTAINERS.md file is up to date and can be found [here](https://github.com/LFDT-web3j/web3j/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)

One virtual events was held in order to promote the project and get more maintainers:
    1. [What’s New With Web3j 5, The Ethereum Integration Library](https://www.meetup.com/lfdt-sf/events/311587684/)
The project continues to encourage additional Web3j users and contributors to increase activity and become maintainers.
The project is happy to mentor anybody interested in becoming a contributor or future maintainer. In terms of mentoring, Web3j took part for the second time in the 2025 LF Decentralized Trust Mentorship program. Two mentorships have been successfully accomplished:
    1. [LFDT - Web3j Libraries Full Development Lifecycle](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/aaa11b52-96b5-46d9-86dc-f5cd099377a1) which was a success in helping to achieve a roadmap goal and close a considerable number of open issues.
    1. [LFDT - Web3j: Enhancing JVM Android Support with Kotlin Wrappers for Solidity Smart Contracts](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/203b283e-8d7c-46d5-bd92-b0c98e00b9ec) which was successful in ensuring the library fully aligns with contemporary development standards for both Android applications and Ethereum blockchain technologies.
The Web3j maintainers also mentor new contributors who are interested in resolving open issues in the project repository—many of which are easy to fix—or by adding new functionalities to the project. Prospective contributors can find detailed instructions in the project’s CONTRIBUTING.md file and are encouraged to seek help in GitHub comments or on Discord.

## Project Adoption

Based on the research conducted on the enterprise users of Web3j there are at least 13 organizations which are using Web3j for production use cases.
The project does not maintain an ADOPTERS file since it is difficult to keep the information up-to-date and the project doesn't want to misrepresent reality or give preference to certain vendors.
Developers occasionally organize events to showcase Web3j features in order to increase adoption by enterprises.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals
The current project roadmap is public and can be found here: [Web3j Roadmap](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WEB3J/pages/23101932/Roadmap+2024+-+2025)

During the last year, the project has achieved the following goals:
- Continue to provide maintenance, resolve issues;
- Implement support for Account Abstraction;
- Web3j 5.x Release;
- Web3J Workshop with Account Abstraction support;
- Improve Windows support;
- Generate Kotlin wrappers for Solidity Smart contracts;
- Add linea RPC APIs EIP-7702 support.


### Next Year's Goals
- Update project roadmap;
- Continue to provide maintenance, resolve issues, and release at least once a month;
- Prague/Electra Upgrade and Future Ethereum Forks;
- Web3j-unit and Web3j-evm updates;
- Improve the process for generation of Kotlin wrappers for Solidity Smart contracts;

### Help Required
We continue to work with LFDT staff to organize events, identify contributors and potential maintainers.
LF Decentralized Trust can help with the following:
- Promote the Web3j project within the LF Decentralized Trust community
- Help with the workshops and summits

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation
This report recommends continuing the `incubation` status.
