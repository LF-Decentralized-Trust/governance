## Project Health

The LFX Insights page of Hiero can be found [here](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=hiero)

The Hiero project started in September 2024 and is growing since that.
Next to the transition of all Hedera repositories that are needed to run a network we already added some repositories to the project that are community driven.
With those projects we already onboarded new contributors to Hiero and even got some new maintainers coming from the community.

Next to transitioning the repositories we are also setting up a more and more open governance model for the project.
We now have several public meetings a week on that we discuss the project and the future of it.

All repositories of the Hiero org receive regular updates and are maintained by the maintainers.

## Maintainer Diversity

<mark>_How many maintainers do you have, and which organizations are they from? How has the maintainers and diversity of your maintainers changed in the past year? Has the number of active maintainers increased/decreased? Has the diversity of maintainers increased/decreased? Please include a link to your existing [MAINTAINERS file](../guidelines/MAINTAINERS-guidelines.md) and the MAINTAINERS file from last year (if appropriate). This is a good opportunity to ensure that your MAINTAINERS file is up to date and to retire any maintainers._
</mark>

As a new project it is always hard to start creating a diverse community.
We are really happy, that we already have maintainers and contributors from different companies and even some that are not employed by a company.
This includes new contributors (and even committers and maintainers) as you can see as example in the contributor list of https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action that is a community driven project which already attracting new contributors from India and Africa.
Another positive example ifor contributions is the YouTube tutorial series for our Python SDK that has been created by a community member: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6uVtTx-oqY8V-HBfenONJrsA0Z8xJymX

## Project Adoption

<mark>_What do you know about adoption, and how has this changed since your last review or since being accepted into LF Decentralized Trust? If you can list companies that are adopters of your project, please do so. Feel free to link to an existing ADOPTERS file if appropriate._

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

Our initial main goal was to move all Hedera repositories to Hiero.
While we are mostly done with that topic we already started to refactor the code to a more vendor neutral / unbranded state.
Here we are currently concentrating on the SDKs and discuss workflows, roadmaps, and patterns.
Information and current state on the transition from Hedera can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md).
Information about our work on making the SDKs vendor neutral can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/blog/2025-03-17-sdk-workflows.md).

With all that work we plan to have first releases of all projects in near future.
Next to that we plan a major release that will contain all the work regarding moving the code to a more vendor neutral project.

Another main goal was and still is the onboarding of community projects from the Hiero ecosystem.
We already moved 3 community projects to Hiero and a new proposal is already in the pipeline.
Information about the onboarding of new projects can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/community-transition.md).

### Next Year's Goals

<mark>_What are the goals for the next year of the project? The goals should list what you want to achieve, not just what you know you can achieve. Feel free to include stretch goals and things that you are looking to explore in the next year. For example, are you working on major new features? Or are you concentrating on adoption, community growth, or documentation?_

### Help Required

As described in the next section we would like to start a discussion with the TAC about moving the project to the graduated state.
Here help (mostly in form of feedback) would be appreciated.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

We are working on all the topics that are needed to move the project to the graduated state (as described in https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-incubation-exit.html).
We believe that we are in a very good state to move to the graduated state in the near future.
We would like to discuss that topic with the TAC.
