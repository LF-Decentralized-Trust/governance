## Project Health

The LFX Insights page of Hiero can be found [here](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=hiero)

The Hiero project began in September 2024 and has been growing ever since.
Along with the transition of all Hedera repositories that are needed to run a network, we added  other community driven repositories.
While developing those projects, we were able to onboard new contributors to Hiero and new maintainers coming from the community.

Next to transitioning the repositories, we are setting up an open governance model for the project.
We kickstarted several public meetings that run on a weekly basis where we discuss the project and its plans for the future.

All repositories within the Hiero organization are regularly updated and actively maintained by the project maintainers.

## Maintainer Diversity

As a new project, it is always hard to start creating a diverse community.
Our community includes maintainers and contributors from different companies and even some that are not employed by a company.
This group includes new contributors (committers and maintainers) as shown in the contributor list of https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action, which is an example of a community driven project attracting new contributors from India and Africa.
Another positive example for contributions is the YouTube tutorial series for our Python SDK that has been created by one of our community members: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6uVtTx-oqY8V-HBfenONJrsA0Z8xJymX

## Project Adoption

The project announced the upcoming elections for two vital positions on the Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC): the End User Seat and the Contributor Seat.
These roles are instrumental in guiding the technical direction and ensuring the diverse representation of our community within the Hiero project.

This election will be held on May 7th until May 31st, 2025.

At the moment, we continue to welcome and encorage nominations.

Our current nominees can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/tree/main/elections/nominees/mar-2025-election)

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

Our initial target was to move all Hedera repositories to Hiero.
While we've mostly finished this transition, we've initiated the process of refactoring the code to a more vendor-agnostic and unbranded architecture.
Our main focus is our SDKs in addition to discussing workflows, roadmaps, and patterns.
Information and current state on the transition from Hedera can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md).
Information about our work on making the SDKs vendor neutral can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/blog/2025-03-17-sdk-workflows.md).

With all of this work in progress, we plan to release the initial minor versions of all projects in the near future.
Next, we plan a major release that will contain all the work from moving the code to a more vendor neutral release.

Another main goal is the onboarding of community projects from the Hiero ecosystem.
At the moment, we moved 3 community projects to Hiero and a new proposal is in the pipeline.
Information about the onboarding of new projects can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/community-transition.md).

On the project's management front, the team is focusing on evaluating and analyzing key project health metrics that track our progress in fostering a thriving and diverse community.
These metrics enable us to assess the project's performance by measuring contributions, code velocity, and issue response and resolution times.

In hiero-ledger we rely on meassuring tools like LFX Insights, Bitergia and GitHub Insights. With the help of Bitergia, we are able to visualize in detail the contributions data for all the work that happened by the Hedera team before September 2024 (which is when the projects started transitioning to Hiero in hiero-ledger GitHub Organization). LFX Insights helps us confirm the contribution statistics for the work that is happening as we continue to move forward in the projects. Other statistics like GH Insights helps us confirm the data in a specific repository at a time whenever we need to direct focus to a particular component. Leveraging all these metrics tools helps us staying accurate and caught up with the fast pace at which the repos continue to transition into https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.
Our metrics report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRxg-3wU-eg0EWEhAu9SRab_sXwJBy5YDQqoeV6BLq0FnVnoO4V41kPYEDYJovtns6tpq9gkaSaSzlO/pub).

### Next Year's Goals

Hiero is a rapidly growing project that is gaining significant traction. We anticipate continued growth in our community's diversity, enabling the adoption of more community-driven components.

The project is expected:

- **Grow their TSC** - Following the recent elections, we anticipate increased participation from members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This growth will enable more companies to take an active role in shaping the project and contribute to the continued expansion of our community.
- **Grow their maintainers and committers** - We are actively encouraging participation from new contributors and raising awareness among current maintainers and committers to review their contributions in accordance with our project guidelines. The goal is to identify and nominate qualified individuals for committer roles. Simultaneously, we are supporting projects in assessing their current resources to identify opportunities for promoting existing committers to maintainer roles, aligned with the newly established criteria.
- **Recruit more participating companies** - As we continue to analyze our contributor metrics, we remain committed to promoting Hiero through events, seminars, and forums to enhance the project's visibility. Our goal is to attract interest from a broader range of companies willing to participate and contribute to the project's objectives. Through these efforts, we aim to increase both the diversity and reach of our community.

Our vendor-neutral releases will provide the project with enhanced flexibility and adaptability, supporting its long-term success.

As a project, we expect Hiero to continue advancing in performance, scalability, and, most importantly, trust.
We remain committed to continue growing our community engagement by encouraging contributions to support both our current and upcoming SDKs, as well as helping to build a more comprehensive Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) with richer test coverage to ensure robust end-to-end validation of our software implementation in our SDKs.
Additionally, we are focused on achieving faster finality, lower latency, and continuously increasing capacity to support larger transactions.

### Help Required

As outlined in the following section, we would like to initiate a discussion with the TAC regarding the transition of the project to the graduated state.
We would greatly appreciate any feedback or guidance on this process.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

We are working on all the topics that are needed to move the project to the graduated state (as described in https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-incubation-exit.html).
We believe that we are in a very good state to move to the graduated state in the near future.
We would like to discuss that topic with the TAC.
