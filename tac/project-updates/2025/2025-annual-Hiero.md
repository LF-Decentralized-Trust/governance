## Project Health

The LFX Insights page of Hiero can be found [here](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=hiero)

The Hiero project began in September 2024 and has been growing ever since.
Along with the transition of all Hedera repositories that are needed to run a network, we added  other community driven repositories.
While developing those projects, we were able to onboard new contributors to Hiero and new maintainers coming from the community.

Next to transitioning the repositories, we are setting up an open governance model for the project.
We kickstarted several public meetings that run on a weekly basis where we discuss the project and it's plans for the future.

All repositories within the Hiero organization are regularly updated and actively maintained by the project maintainers.

## Maintainer Diversity

<mark>_How many maintainers do you have, and which organizations are they from? How has the maintainers and diversity of your maintainers changed in the past year? Has the number of active maintainers increased/decreased? Has the diversity of maintainers increased/decreased? Please include a link to your existing [MAINTAINERS file](../guidelines/MAINTAINERS-guidelines.md) and the MAINTAINERS file from last year (if appropriate). This is a good opportunity to ensure that your MAINTAINERS file is up to date and to retire any maintainers._
</mark>

As a new project, it is always hard to start creating a diverse community.
Our community includes maintainers and contributors from different companies and even some that are not employed by a company.
This group includes new contributors (committers and maintainers) as shown in the contributor list of https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action, which is an example of a community driven project attracting new contributors from India and Africa.
Another positive example for contributions is the YouTube tutorial series for our Python SDK that has been created by one of our community members: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6uVtTx-oqY8V-HBfenONJrsA0Z8xJymX

## Project Adoption

<mark>_What do you know about adoption, and how has this changed since your last review or since being accepted into LF Decentralized Trust? If you can list companies that are adopters of your project, please do so. Feel free to link to an existing ADOPTERS file if appropriate._

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

Our initial target was to move all Hedera repositories to Hiero.
While we've mostly finished this transition, we've initiated the process of refactoring the code to a more vendor-agnostic and unbranded architecture.
Our main focus is our SDKs in addition to discussing workflows, roadmaps, and patterns.
Information and current state on the transition from Hedera can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md).
Information about our work on making the SDKs vendor neutral can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/blog/2025-03-17-sdk-workflows.md).

With all of this work in progress, we plan to release the initial minor versions of all projects in the near future.
Next, we plan a major release that will contain all the work from moving the code to a more vendor neutral release.

Another main goal is the onboarding of community projects from the Hiero ecosystem.
At the moment, we moved 3 community projects to Hiero and a new proposal is in the pipeline.
Information about the onboarding of new projects can be found [here](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/community-transition.md).

### Next Year's Goals

<mark>_What are the goals for the next year of the project? The goals should list what you want to achieve, not just what you know you can achieve. Feel free to include stretch goals and things that you are looking to explore in the next year. For example, are you working on major new features? Or are you concentrating on adoption, community growth, or documentation?_

### Help Required

As outlined in the following section, we would like to initiate a discussion with the TAC regarding the transition of the project to the graduated state.
We would greatly appreciate any feedback or guidance on this process.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

We are working on all the topics that are needed to move the project to the graduated state (as described in https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-incubation-exit.html).
We believe that we are in a very good state to move to the graduated state in the near future.
We would like to discuss that topic with the TAC.
