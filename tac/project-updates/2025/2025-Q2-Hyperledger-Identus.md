# Project Health

The [LF Decentralized Trust Identus LFX Insight Dashboard](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=identus&routedFrom=Github&bestPractice=false&repository=all&dateFilters=Last%20Quarter&dateRange=2025-01-01%20to%202025-03-31&compare=PP&granularity=week&hideBots=true) indicates growth in both contributors and commits to the Identus Platform compared to the previous quarter.

While the primary maintainer of the Identus Platform is the Input Output (IOG) organization, community members and external organizations have also actively contributed, including:
- [Blocktrust](https://www.blocktrust.dev/)
- [Socious.io](https://socious.io/)
- [Ahau.io](https://ahau.io/)

# Questions/Issues for the TAC

The Identus team is currently revising its roadmap and removing items that have lost priority or relevance. As part of this effort, the following capability is being put on hold:

- **UAS wrapper** – This feature is considered more of an R&D capability, and there is currently no real customer demand for it.

---

# Releases

The migration of Identus Platform repositories under the `hyperledger-identus` GitHub organization has temporarily slowed the release cadence.

The team is now focused on the upcoming [Identus Platform v2.15 release](https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/.github/releases/tag/v2.15), expected by the end of April.

---

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The Identus community remains active across two Discord servers:
- **LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT)**
- [**Identus Community Discord**](https://discord.gg/SCB2eqU4)

Community members continue to ask questions, report issues, and engage in discussions about various use cases. Both the core team and community contributors are actively supporting these interactions.

# Current Plans

The strategic direction remains consistent with the annual report. The main goals are to:

- Reduce the maintenance cost and complexity of the Identus Platform
- Increase adoption among developers and organizations
- Enhance interoperability with other Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platforms
- Improve documentation and developer tutorials

Planned features for the upcoming year include:
- Cardano Identus VDR
- Issuance capabilities in the SDKs
- OIDC support: OID4VCI, OID4VP, and SIOP 2.0
- Authentication via the PRISM DID method

Additional features under consideration:
- Support for JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials
- Support for OpenBadges 3.0 Verifiable Credentials
- Integration with WebWallets

To align with Hyperledger Project Lifecycle Criteria, the team also plans to:
- Enable the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
- Enable the OpenSSF Scorecard Badge

# Maintainer Diversity

Socious has increased its presence on both Discord and GitHub. Additionally, new external contributors—such as **@Yummy-Yums**—have joined the community, bringing fresh perspectives and contributions.

---

# Contributor Diversity

The main contributor to the Identus project continues to be Input Output Global (IOG). However, Blocktrust and Socious are also actively contributing to the codebase and discussions. Interest from new engineers is growing, as evidenced by increased participation on Discord and in weekly community meetings.

---

# Additional Information

The Identus team is also focused on integrating SSI capabilities into IOG’s **Midnight** and **Lace** projects. These efforts are expected to boost the adoption of the Identus Platform within the broader Cardano ecosystem.
