# 2025 Annual Review Hyperledger Caliper

## Project Health

Hyperledger Caliper is mature and stable with it's 0.6 release. Interest in Caliper still exists from questions asked on discord, PRs and Issues raised. There have been several small contributions recently to improve the newly added documentation format published at the end of last year. The majority of last years contributions were from the 2 Hyperledger mentees and 1 maintainer which resulted in a new documentation format being published,  improvements to the unit tests and a 0.6 release.

## Maintainer Diversity

[Hyperledger Caliper maintainers](https://github.com/hyperledger-caliper/caliper/blob/08f732a484c93285fdc4df628f10cbc8d454d583/MAINTAINERS.md) as of end 2024 (unchanged compared to the previous quarter):
* Dave Kelsey (UK)
* Attila Klenik (NTCA|BME, Hungary)

## Project Adoption

Given the questions from discord and the occasional PR and issue, Caliper is still used for Besu and Fabric benchmark testing by users of those solutions. I don't know of any other way to determine adoption.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

The main goals for 2024 were to improve the unit tests that exist in the code base and to deliver a new documentation format based on the recommendations of Hyperledger. Both of these were achieved using Hyperledger mentees.
Other standard goals are to fix issues and publish new releases as required. An example of last year was the report of a security vulnerability which resulted in the 0.6 release of Caliper to include that fix plus a few other minor fixes.

### Next Year's Goals

No plans have been made yet for Caliper this year but as always we will ensure timely maintenance of Caliper if an important bug or security issue arises.

### Help Required

No known help required at this time.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

Recommend no change to current lifecycle status.
