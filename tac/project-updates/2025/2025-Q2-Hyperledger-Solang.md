# Project Health

We are in the process of preparing Solang for launch to Stellar's developer audience. We have applied to a mentorship program, through which the mentee will work on Solang/Stellar integration-related tasks.

# Questions/Issues for the TAC

- We would want to add [Solang Playground](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang-playground) to [Hyperledger Solang Organization], would that be possible? 
- Does it make sense to publish a pre-alpha release? (We are currently working toward an Alpha release.)

# Releases

As mentioned in previous project updates, we plan to publish a new release once Solang reaches a sufficient level of readiness for testing by Stellar developersâ€”specifically, an Alpha release that we will name `Meridian`.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

- We have been working on supporting all data types for the Soroban target.
- Work towards supporting a Soroban token contract. This invovles supporting emitting events, Hashmaps as well as access control Soroban primitives
- We completed the mentee selection process for the 2025 Solang mentorship program.
- The Solang Playground UI is now ready for use.

# Current Plans

- Onboard the selected mentee to Solang. The Solang codebase is quite large, and compiler development is a niche area, so onboarding must be done carefully.
- Prepare for the Alpha release of Solang targeting Soroban developers.

# Maintainer Diversity

- No new maintainers have been added since the last report.


# Contributor Diversity

We have had two new contributors since the last report:

- Our mentee, who has already started contributing to tasks that will help onboard them more deeply into the project.
- @smoelius from @crytic is making regular contributions
