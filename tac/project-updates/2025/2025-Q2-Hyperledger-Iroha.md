# Project Health

Hyperledger Iroha 2 has maintained steady progress and regular development since its MVP release. 
The latest version,  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1.5">2.0.0-rc.1.5</a>, has been successfully 
rolled out for real-world deployments in Palau Invest, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea, primarily as part of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) solution.


Additionally, the team is in the final stages of releasing the <a href="https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha2-block-explorer-web">Iroha 2 Blockchain Explorer</a>, 
further enhancing the network's user interface and accessibility.

Regular monthly community calls have resumed, providing the community with timely updates and gathering 
valuable feedback for continual improvement. Real-time support remains consistently active via our dedicated Telegram channel.

Looking ahead, significant enhancements planned for upcoming releases include the introduction of a transaction fees module,
a hub chain implementation, and upgrades to network runtime. Efforts continue on optimizing memory consumption and addressing memory leaks.
