# Project Health

Hiero has experienced a 45% increase in [active contributors](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/hiero/contributors?timeRange=custom&start=2025-04-01&end=2025-06-12&widget=active-contributors) compared to the previous quarter. In recent months, the project successfully completed the transfer of Hedera owned components and is now focusing on the migration of community driven projects. Concurrently, we remain committed to advancing brand neutrality and are preparing for future releases under the Hiero namespace. In parallel, we have been actively preparing for the upcoming graduation application, which is scheduled for submission on August 1.

Our number of [active organizations](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/hiero/contributors?timeRange=custom&start=2025-04-01&end=2025-06-12&widget=active-organizations) remains stable, with new communities continuing to discover Hiero and recognize the project's potential impact. During the recent elections, we observed a notable increase in project adopters and successfully onboarded [two new TSC members](https://hiero.org/blog/results-of-the-hiero-technical-steering-committee-elections/), representing the Contributor and End User seats.

Hiero has experienced a noticeable increase in the number of issues opened and resolved, along with a rise in [commit activity](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/hiero/development?timeRange=custom&start=2025-04-01&end=2025-06-12) which is an encouraging indicator of the project's growing popularity and discovery by new contributors and adopters. To further promote community engagement, we launched a new [Hiero blog](https://hiero.org/blog/) section, where technical documentation and project updates are being published. Additionally, Hiero is scheduled to present a project seminar at Rare Evo in August, further expanding its visibility within the broader ecosystem along with other LFDT projects.

# Questions/Issues for the TAC

<mark>_Required: If there are any specific issues that the TAC should be aware of or specifically address, then please call them out. If not, then it is helpful to state something like: "There are no issues at this time." When in doubt, it is better to include information or questions, rather than waiting._
</mark>

# Releases

<mark>_Required: Regular software product releases are a sign of a healthy project. Reports should list the releases made since your last report, along with the release date of each. NOTE: If no releases were made, list the date of the most recent prior release._
</mark>

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Hiero Ledger has seen a notable increase in activity in recent months. The project has successfully launched new project specific community calls, which remain publicly accessible via the [Hiero calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week). Currently, we are collaborating with the Python SDK team to organize their first "Office Hours" and Hackathon session, scheduled to take place in the coming weeks. Additionally, the team has proposed initiating a recurring monthly Hackathon focused on development for the [Hiero](https://hiero.org/) website.

As more [components continue to be transitioned](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/community-transition.md) into the hiero-ledger ecosystem, we are encouraging project teams to host regular community calls to support collaboration, accelerate development, and enhance overall project performance.

While activity on the public mailing lists has remained minimal, we are actively directing community engagement toward the Hiero Discord channel, which continues to serve as the primary hub for discussion and support. At the same time, we continue to observe consistent community engagement through GitHub Issues and Discussions.

Following the recent approval of updated [roles and groups guidelines](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/governance/blob/main/roles-and-groups.md) by the TSC, and their subsequent adoption by the community, we are encouraging teams to review their structures and consider promoting additional committers and maintainers where appropriate. These guidelines provide a clear framework for aligning with best practices, allowing teams to assess their current processes and make informed improvements. We continue to offer support and guidance to team leads seeking assistance in implementing these standards.

# Current Plans

<mark>_Required: A healthy project will often be working towards a common goal, or have a shared understanding of what is being done next - even if individual contributors have their own "itches". What are the main features planned? What releases are planned? Are there any specific efforts or branches of development underway? This does not need to be described in technical detail. Conversely, if the activity is minimal, discuss how the project plans to address that - whether through seeking out new contributors, maintaining in a dormant but available state, or planning towards a move to a Deprecated (and ultimately End of Life) state._

# Maintainer Diversity

<mark>_Required: Please include the maintainers that were added since your last report. This information will allow us to track the diversity and growth of the maintainers of the project. NOTE: If no maintainers were added since your last report, provide the list of existing maintainers._
</mark>

# Contributor Diversity

<mark>_Required: A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. Healthy projects also serve the needs of many parties. Include information on the number of unique organizations currently contributing to the project. NOTE: The contributions do not need to be source code._
</mark>

# Additional Information

<mark>_Optional: Please provide any additional information that you feel would be useful for TAC to be aware._
