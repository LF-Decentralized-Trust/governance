# Project Health
CREDEBL Team is actively working on upgrading the current platform to support new standards such as OpenId4VC adding new credential formats such as ISO mDoc, SD-JWT, and DC API Support.

The [active contributors](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/credebl/contributors?timeRange=previousQuarter&start=2025-10-01&end=2025-12-31&widget=active-contributors) are decreased in this quarter. Majority of the contributors are from AYANWORKS team. We are  working with LFDT staff to increase the outreach to built a more diverse community of contributors.

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is currently not actively meeting. We are planning to revive the TSC and from this quarter and we plan to schedule regular meetings. We will make the related public announcement in the community soon.
