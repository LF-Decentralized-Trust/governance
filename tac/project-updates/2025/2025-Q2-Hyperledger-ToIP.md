# ToIP 2025 Q2 Quarterly Report

See our [2024 Annual Report](../2024/2024-annual-review-Hyperledger-ToIP.md) for background information about ToIP.

In the first half of 2025, our active Working Groups were:

1. Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)  
2. Technology Stack Working Group (TSWG)  
3. Ecosystem & Governance Working Group (EGWG)  
4. KERI Suite Working Group (KSWG)  
5. Data Modeling and Representation Working Group (DMRWG)  
6. Concepts and Terminology Working Group (CTWG)

For a status report from each of these WGs, see [this Google Slides deck from our June 2025 All-Members meeting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SBTSCsYlxRz_xjpWemxy3rhixSdhZDt29BKipDYlVpk/edit?usp=sharing).

In its May 2025 meeting, the ToIP Steering Committee approved two new Working Groups:

1. AI & Human Trust Working Group (AIMWG) — began work in July 2025.  
2. Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group (DTGWG) — will begin work in September 2025.

The charters for both of these new GGs follow below. Both WGs have the following standard JDF IPR terms:

* Copyright mode: [**Creative Commons Attribution 4.0**](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)**.**   
* Patent mode: **W3C Mode** (based on the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205)).

# AI & Human Trust Working Group (AIMWG) Charter

*(Supersedes the [AI & Human Trust Task Force](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22982892/AI+huMan+trust+Task+Force) of the TSWG)*

The AI and Human Trust Working Group (AIM) is to focus on studies and recommendations that (1) apply ToIP solutions to enhance human trust in AI technologies, and (2) integrate AI technologies to better solve trust challenges in the context of human and AI interactions.The Working Group’s deliverables may include insight reports, position white papers, and specifications and recommendations. 

*Example areas of work include but not limited to White papers about strengthening trust in human and AI interactions leveraging the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP) and other components of the ToIP stack, Communication protocols between AI agents, and between AI agents and non-AI data resources, services, tools etc., Authenticity and provenance of content and data, Personhood and AI agent identities, Delegation, accountability, and control of AI agents, and How to build trust in AI Agents frameworks.*

All IPR options will remain the same as the latest TSWG charter.

# Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group (DTGWG) Charter

The scope of the Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group (DTGWG) is to define the socio-technical standards for a decentralized trust graph where there is no centralized database and all parties control their own subgraph of trust relationships. This work includes specifying requirements for key management and recovery, verifiable identifiers, verifiable credentials, verifiable relationship credentials, social vouching, relationship cards (r-cards), privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs, trust task protocols, trust registries, out-of-band introductions, UI/UX affordances, decentralized naming and discovery mechanisms, and governance considerations. This work will be based on the Design Principles for the ToIP Stack, the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification, other ToIP technical specifications, and complementary open standards for decentralized digital trust infrastructure.
