# Project Health

We are introducing Solang to the Stellar ecosystem through the Solang Playground, available at: https://solang.io/.
Additionally, Solang was selected for mentorship, and our mentee, @guptapratykshh, has been actively contributing across the compiler (fixing bugs, adding new data types for the Stellar target, and implementing end-to-end tests).

# Questions/Issues for the TAC

No issues at the moment.

# Releases

We shipped the London release: https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/releases/tag/v0.3.4
This release expands Soroban support, updates LLVM to version 16, and fixes numerous minor bugs.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

- We have been migrating all [Soroban examples](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main) to Solidity using Solang.
- Our mentee, @guptapratykshh, has been adding end-to-end tests for existing examples, introducing support for new types on Stellar, and landing bug fixes for array behavior in Solidity.

# Current Plans

- Engage ecosystem leads from interested chains to try https://solang.io/ through in-person workshops and provide actionable feedback.
