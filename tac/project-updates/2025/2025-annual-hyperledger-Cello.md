# Project Health

The [Hyperledger Cello](https://github.com/hyperledger-cello/cello) project is more mature this quarter, and we continue to focus on the v1.1 release after the v1.0 version. 

The key accomplishments and initiatives this quarter include:

* Technical Upgrades: Finished the upgrade to support the new LTS version of hyperleger fabric and the channel operation features, following our planned roadmap. Now the team is working on the chaincode operation features, which is the last piece for the v1.1 release.

* Development Environment Enhancement: Fixed remaining issues after upgrading from Node.js v14 to v20, along with migrating from npm to yarn package manager.

* Mentorship Program: The mentor project in the year 2024 is done, and the intern student (haibo yang) is still working actively on the project.

* Long-term Goals: 
    * Finish v1.1 release as planed;
    * Improve the QA, including adding more test cases and documentation;
    * Support more blockchain networks such as Hyperledger Besu.

## Maintainer Diversity

We currently have four maintainers now, and two maintainers are not that active due to working on other directions, including Feng Yang and Yuanmao Zhu. We will retire the inactive maintainers and recruit new ones:

Baohua Yang (Oracle)
Feng Yang (H3C)
Yuanmao Zhu (Coinbase)
Xichen Pan (University of British Columbia)

# Project Adoption
Based on the Github issues, there are some adoptions, but we do not have the exact number.

# Goals

## Performance Against Prior Goals
The Cello team is mainly working on the new feature development as planed, as long as fixing bugs and improve documentations.

Throughout the recent quarters, we maintained project stability through active bug fixing and timely responses to GitHub issues, supporting our community of users and contributors.

## Next Year's Goals
The v1.1 version will be released in early Q2, 2025.

The v1.2 version will be released in the 2nd half of 2025.

## Help Required
When will the maintainers are able to update the meeting calendar, without needing to contact LF staffs to help?


# Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

The TAC had a constructive and thoughtful discussion on the current state of Cello's community. TAC recognizes and appreciate the dedication of a few maintainers whose efforts stand out. At the same time, the TAC identified several areas that need attention to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of the project.

Key concerns include an outdated security policy document, the absence of a documented release process, irregular release cycles, and tokens with potentially elevated privileges. Additionally, the community’s responsiveness on support channels—such as GitHub issues and Discord—along with a growing number of long-pending pull requests, signal the need for stronger community engagement and maintenance practices.

Recognizing the potential of the project, the TAC recommends that the team continue to grow and strengthen the community under the Labs program. Once foundational improvements are in place, the team is encouraged to reapply for incubation.
