# Project Health

The Hyperledger Cello project is more mature this quarter, and we continue to focus on the v1.1 release after the v1.0 version. 

The key accomplishments and initiatives this quarter include:

* Technical Upgrades: Finished the upgrade to support the new LTS version of hyperleger fabric and the channel operation features, following our planned roadmap. Now the team is working on the chaincode operation features, which is the last piece for the v1.1 release.

* Development Environment Enhancement: Fixed remaining issues after upgrading from Node.js v14 to v20, along with migrating from npm to yarn package manager.

* Mentorship Program: The mentor project in the year 2024 is done, and the intern student (haibo yang) is still working actively on the project.

* Long-term Goals: 
    * Finish v1.1 release as planed;
    * Improve the QA, including adding more test cases and documentation;
    * Support more blockchain networks such as Hyperledger Besu.

## Maintainer Diversity

We currently have four maintainers now, and two maintainers are not that active due to working on other directions, including Feng Yang and Yuanmao Zhu. We will retire the inactive maintainers and recruit new ones:

Baohua Yang (Oracle)
Feng Yang (H3C)
Yuanmao Zhu (Coinbase)
Xichen Pan (University of British Columbia)

# Project Adoption
Based on the Github issues, there are some adoptions, but we do not have the exact number.

# Goals

## Performance Against Prior Goals
The Cello team is mainly working on the new feature development as planed, as long as fixing bugs and improve documentations.

Throughout the recent quarters, we maintained project stability through active bug fixing and timely responses to GitHub issues, supporting our community of users and contributors.

## Next Year's Goals
The v1.1 version will be released in early Q2, 2025.

The v1.2 version will be released in the 2nd half of 2025.

## Help Required
When will the maintainers are able to update the meeting calendar, without needing to contact LF staffs to help?


# Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

The project is stable and more mature. Release v1.1 is on the way. 

So incubation of graduated are the recommended status.
