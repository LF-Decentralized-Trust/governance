# 2025 Q3 Hyperledger Caliper

## Project Health

Caliper is a fairly mature and stable tool for Hyperledger Fabric benchmarking and as such is in maintenance mode at this time. It supports Fabric 2.5 LTS and also works with Fabric 3.x releases. Hyperledger Caliper will officially support Fabric 3.x once an LTS release (ie production ready version) is made available.

* 2 active maintainers
* Questions on Discord and GitHub are responded to
* Contributor discussions happen mostly on Discord

## Questions/Issues for the TAC

Not at this time.

## Releases

The latest stable release is v0.6.0; we're also continuously publishing unstable releases after every merged PR (no new releases):

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperledger/caliper-cli/v/0.6.0)
* [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/hyperledger/caliper/0.6.0/images/sha256-ace68b58b329a5f2c5bd569cc2f59b7f64e9bbee1f3bb9f4f8a97469b55d7b2b?context=explore)

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Not much activity this quarter as it is mainly holiday season and other priorities mean that only small updates to the caliper code base have been made. Discord, GitHub issues and Stack Overflow have been monitored and responded to.

## Current Plans

* We still hope to include a Polkadot connector for Hyperledger Caliper by the end of the year.
* Aim to have another Caliper release delivered by the end of the year.
