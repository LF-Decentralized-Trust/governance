# 2025 Q3 Besu

## Project Health

Hyperledger Besu continues to demonstrate strong project health in Q3 2025, maintaining its position as a critical Ethereum execution client while advancing significant performance and stability improvements. The quarter saw continued focus on block creation reliability, caching optimizations for improved sync performance, and enhancements to the transaction pool management system.

### Major Accomplishments This Quarter

**Performance Under Non-Finality Conditions**: A significant achievement in Q3 was the implementation of enhanced caching mechanisms for block headers, specifically designed to improve performance during non-finality conditions. The new `--cache-last-block-headers` flag allows operators to cache thousands of block headers independently from full block caching, significantly improving sync performance and reducing database load during chain reorganizations.

**Block Creation Resilience**: The team implemented comprehensive exception handling for block creation, addressing edge cases that previously caused block production failures. This included protection against unexpected runtime exceptions from plugins and internal components, with automatic rollback mechanisms to maintain clean state and continue block production.

**Transaction Pool Enhancements**: Q3 saw critical improvements to transaction pool management, including better handling of transaction selection timeouts, improved logging for transaction penalization, and separation of executor services for time-critical operations. These changes significantly improved block creation reliability under high load conditions.

### Quarterly Release Summary

During Q3 2025, the Besu project released:

- **Besu 25.9.0** (September): Transaction pool optimizations and EthStats compatibility fixes
- Additional point releases addressing security vulnerabilities and bug fixes

These releases included over 40 merged pull requests focusing on performance improvements, stability enhancements, and developer experience.
