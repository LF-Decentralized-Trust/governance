## Project Health

LF Decentralized Trust Web3j [LFX Insights Dashboard](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=web3j)

The project is relatively new to the LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem. It was migrated to Hyperledger Foundation from Web3 Labs organization at the beginning of 2024.
At the same time, over the past year, we have seen several new contributors and evidence of usage of the Web3j by other companies such as NTT, Quant, FreedomFactory, Hedera. 
Contributors are joining the Web3j Contributors happens every 2 weeks, [calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/lf-decentralized-trust?view=month).
There is also Discord activity.

Highlights from the 2024 Insights report:
- 125 contributors 
- 402 commits 
- 72% of code activities were performed by 1 organization (Web3 Labs)
- Total of 30 contributors contributed, which indicates that there are many contributors and organizations with interest in Web3j.


## Maintainer Diversity

At the moment there are only 3 maintainers (all from Web3 Labs).

The MAINTAINERS.md file is up to date and can be found [here](https://github.com/LFDT-web3j/web3j/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)

Three virtual events were held in order to promote the project and get more maintainers:
    1. [Introducing Hyperledger Web3j: The Ethereum Integration Library for Enterprises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcT2XN4wc3clist=PL0MZ85B_96CG9XJne_tJPEDOsKMkhROV2&index=1)
    2. [Hyperledger Web3j: What’s New With The Smart Contract & Ethereum Network Library](https://www.meetup.com/lfdt-london/events/304029316/)
    3. [1st Hyperledger Web3j Summit: Community](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WEB3J/pages/48070770/1st+Hyperledger+Web3j+Summit+Community)
The project would still encourage additional Web3j users and contributors to increase activity and become maintainers.
The project is happy to mentor anybody interested in becoming a contributor or future maintainer. In terms of mentoring, Web3j took part for the first time in the 2024 Hyperledger Menthorship program, [Hyperledger Web3j: Enhancing Android Support with Updated web3j-android Integration](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/x/TBhPAQ) which was a sucess in helping to achieve a roadmap goal.
The Web3j maintainers also mentor new contributors who are interested in resolving open issues in the project repository—many of which are easy to fix—or by adding new functionalities to the project. Prospective contributors can find detailed instructions in the project’s CONTRIBUTING.md file and are encouraged to seek help in GitHub comments or on Discord.

## Project Adoption

Based on the research did on the enterprise users of Web3j there are at least 12 organizations which are using Web3j for production use case.
The project does not maintain an ADOPTERS file since it is difficult to keep the information up-to-date and the project doesn't want to misrepresent reality or give preference to certain vendors.
Developers occasionally organize events to showcase Web3j features in order to increase adoption by enterprises.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals
The current project roadmap is public and can be found here: [Web3j Roadmap](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WEB3J/pages/23101932/Roadmap+2024+-+2025)

During the last six months, the project has achieved the following goals:
- Generic struct functionality implementation;
- Upgrade web3j-android branch with to latest version and release libraries as android artifacts - this was done during the Hyperledger mentorship 2024;
- First Web3J Hyperledger Ecosystem Summit;
- Reduce part of the open issues and connect with the community in different events;
- Improve ENS integration support.

Other accomplishments:
- Migrate the project under LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem.

### Next Year's Goals
- Continue to provide maintenance, resolve issues, releases at least once a month;
- Implement the support for Account Abstraction;
- Prague/Electra Upgrade and Future Ethereum Forks;
- Web3j 5.x Release;
- Web3J Workshop with Account Abstraction support;
- Improve Windows support;
- Web3j-unit and Web3j-evm updates;
- Generate Kotlin wrappers for Solidity Smart contracts;
- Add linea RPC APIs EIP-7702 support.

### Help Required
We continue to work with LFDT staff to organize events, identify contributors and potential maintainers.
LF Decentralized Trust can help with the following:
- Promote the Web3j project within the LF Decentralized Trust community
- Help with the workshops and summits

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation
The Web3j is a reasonably new incubation project in the LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem and should remain so.
