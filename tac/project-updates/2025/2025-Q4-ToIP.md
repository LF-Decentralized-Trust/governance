# ToIP Quarterly Report for 2025 Q4

# How are you progressing against your yearly goals?

2025 was a major transition year for ToIP. This was our first year moving under the LFDT umbrella, without our own membership or Executive Director, and with a Steering Committee elected from the membership.

So our main goals were to complete this transition successfully, fully integrate with the LFDT staff and infrastructure, and ensure that all our Working Groups were still on track with their deliverables. We were satisfied that we met these goals.

# What deliverables/outputs did you have in the past quarter?

The [KERI Suite Working Group](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/56819755/KERI+Suite+Working+Group), approved three Working Group Approved Deliverables and submitted them to the Steering Committee to begin the ToIP Approved Deliverable process.

The Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group began meeting weekly in October and formed its two first Task Forces:

* Risk Assessment and Harms Prevention Task Force: [https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/269025285/Risk+Assessment+Harms+Prevention+Task+Force](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/269025285/Risk+Assessment+Harms+Prevention+Task+Force)

Lastly, the Steering Committee worked with LFDT staff to put on the two-day ToIP Fifth Anniversary Virtual Symposium, which was a major success. See the full agenda and recordings:

The Steering Committee also developed a process and checklist for advancing Working Group Approved Deliverables to ToIP Approved Deliverable as specified in the our Joint Development Foundation charter.

# What are your goals for the next quarter?

Since we have a significant group of specifications coming to maturity at the same time, our goals for 2026 Q1 are:

1. Complete the process of approving the KERI Suite Working Group specs as ToIP Approved Deliverables.  
2. Approve the four Technology Stack Working Group specifications listed above as Working Group Approved Deliverables; then go through the process to approve them as ToIP Approved Deliverables.  
3. Complete a new simplified, updated ToIP website with updated content and ideally an AI chatbot (see the next section).  
4. Participate in the H2H Summit on Human Agency event on February 23 (focused on decentralized digital identity and trust infrastructure using ToIP specifications) and the Linux Foundation Member Summit on February 24-25.

# Do you need any help?

Yes, the following would be very helpful:

1. Assistance and review from LFDT staff in preparation of a ToIP specification template with all necessary boilerplate, formatting, and boilerplate to meet JDF and LFDT requirements.  
2. Technical, design, and implementation assistance for the new ToIP website and AI chatbot.  
3. Support on harmonizing and integrating ToIP contributions with LFDT contributions to the H2H Summit on Human Agency and the LF Member Summit.

# Changes to maintainer/contributor diversity

No changes this quarter. We continue to hold as many calls as possible for both AM/EU and APAC time zones, and to attract as many participants from underrepresented groups as possible.
