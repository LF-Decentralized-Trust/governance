# 2025 Annual Review Hyperledger Aries

## Project Health

The Hyperledger Aries project has successfully transitioned its key sub-projects to the [OpenWallet Foundation], ensuring their continued growth and adoption. This marks the conclusion of Hyperledger Aries under the LFDT umbrella, with this being the final LFDT Annual Report for the project.

[OpenWallet Foundation]: https://openwallet.foundation/

Several Aries sub-projects, including [ACA-Py](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy) and [Credo-TS](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts), have already found a new home in the [OpenWallet Foundation], while [Aries VCX](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx) is expected to follow shortly. The remaining repositories in Aries will be evaluated in the coming weeks, with a clear path defined for their continued maintenance or archival.

## Legacy and Impact

Since its inception, Hyperledger Aries has been a foundational project in decentralized identity, enabling verifiable credential exchanges across enterprises, governments, and open-source ecosystems. Its impact can be seen in:

- The adoption of Aries-based technologies in digital identity initiatives worldwide.
- The evolution of privacy-preserving and interoperable credential exchange protocols.
- The successful migration of Aries components to the [OpenWallet Foundation], where they continue to thrive.

## Maintainer Diversity

As Aries formally winds down, its maintainers have largely shifted their focus to projects within the [OpenWallet Foundation]. While active maintenance of the remaining Aries repositories has declined, the community that built Aries continues to support and evolve its core technologies under new governance structures.

Aries teams and a list of repositories can be found in the [Hyperledger GitHub organization Control file](https://github.com/hyperledger/governance/blob/main/access-control.yaml).

## Project Adoption

Interest in the components that had been in Aries remains very high.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

For the record...2024 was a great and very busy year for the Aries collaborators.

* ✅ Completion of the Unqualified DIDs Community Coordinated Update
* ✅ Continued development and publication of Aries best practices.
    * ✅ Ideally, leading to a Long Term Support (LTS) program and an initial LTS release.
* ✅ Ledger Agnostic AnonCreds support within Aries projects
* ✅ OIDC4VC Protocol support, including relevant VC formats
* ✅ Aries RFC Cleanup — Status Review and the human friendly publication of the Aries Protocol RFCs integrated with the DIDComm Protocols.
* ✅ An evolution of the 'Start Here' documentation for the Aries Frameworks
* Marketing: Publishing information about the range and maturity of Aries capabilities, and improving the overall awareness of Aries in Digital Trust and corporate circles.
    * ❌ Publishing a scalability report.
    * ✅ Information about the Aries frameworks’s flexibility in interacting with non-Indy ledgers/VDRs, and other than AnonCreds verifiable credentials.
    * ❌ Visibility of implementations and deployments
* Continue/Expand alignment / interop efforts
    * ❌ JFF PlugFest
    * ✅ Aries Interopathon
    * ✅ OWF
    * ❌ Open Agent Framework
* ✅ [Aries Interop Profile (AIP) 2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md) completion / ❌ AIP 3 definition
    * ✅ DIDComm v2 / ❌ Trust Spanning Layer

### Next Steps

The remaining eight Aries repositories are being evaluated to determine an appropriate final disposition. This includes:

- Identifying repositories with ongoing value and facilitating their transition to the [OpenWallet Foundation] or other relevant communities. Of note, the invaluable [Aries RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs) repository and [website](https://hyperledger.github.io/aries-rfcs/) are likely to move to the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation)'s DIDComm Working Group.
- Archiving repositories that are no longer maintained or needed.
- Ensuring proper documentation is in place for any future reference or migration efforts.

### Help Required

No help is formally needed. Perhaps a raised glass when the project wraps up.

## Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

With its core technologies now under the [OpenWallet Foundation], Hyperledger Aries has effectively **completed its lifecycle** within LFDT. The project should be formally **archived** in the coming months, ensuring that all valuable assets have been appropriately transitioned or documented for historical reference.

## TAC Review Notes

*To be added after the TAC Meeting that covers the final review of Hyperledger Aries.*
