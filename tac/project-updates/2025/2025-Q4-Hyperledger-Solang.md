We are in the final stages of launching Solang Playground to Solidity developers. We have implemented a modern UI/UX and are applying the final tweaks.

For Solang, we worked on support for user-defined structs, as well as storage vectors, for the Soroban target.

Our mentee, @guptapratykshh, continues to contribute to Solang, including adding support for the (U)int256 data type for the Soroban target.
