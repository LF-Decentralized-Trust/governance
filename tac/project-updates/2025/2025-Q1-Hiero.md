# Project Health

The Hiero project started in September 2024 and is growing since that.
Next to the transition of all Hedera repositories that are needed to run a network we already added some repositories to the project that are community driven.
With those projects we already onboarded new contributors to Hiero and even got some new maintainers coming from the community.

Next to transitioning the repositories we are also setting up a more and more open governance model for the project.
We now have several public meetings a week on that we discuss the project and the future of it.

All repositories of the Hiero org receive regular updates and are maintained by the maintainers.

# Questions/Issues for the TAC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

We already did releases for some of the repositories that have been transfered to Hiero.
Currently, we are working on publishing releases (like to Maven Central).
Most progress has been done in the SDK and tooling repositories.

We currently define a roadmap about an initial v0.X and a v1.0 release for the consensus node.

Some repositories that are community driven are also working on their first releases or already published them:
We have a GitHub Action that has published a first release to the GitHub marketplace and our Python SDK has published a first release to pypi.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Since the transition of our repos happened in the past quarter we tracked a lot of activity.
We believe it does not make sense to give an overview of specific repositories or contributions at this point of time.
But we are really happy that we already achieved to onboard new contributors and maintainers to the project.
To do so we make use of the LFDT Discord, GitHub discussions and have scheduled several weekly and bi-weekly community meetings.
We see new people coming up at all of those places and are happy to see that the project is growing.

# Current Plans

<mark>_Required: A healthy project will often be working towards a common goal, or have a shared understanding of what is being done next - even if individual contributors have their own "itches". What are the main features planned? What releases are planned? Are there any specific efforts or branches of development underway? This does not need to be described in technical detail. Conversely, if the activity is minimal, discuss how the project plans to address that - whether through seeking out new contributors, maintaining in a dormant but available state, or planning towards a move to a Deprecated (and ultimately End of Life) state._

TODO: Add companies

# Contributor Diversity

<mark>_Required: A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. Healthy projects also serve the needs of many parties. Include information on the number of unique organizations currently contributing to the project. NOTE: The contributions do not need to be source code._
</mark>

TODO: Add all companies

As a new project it is always hard to start creating a diverse community.
We are really happy, that we already have contributors from different companies and even some that are not employed by a company.
This includes new contributors (and even committers and maintainers) as you can see as example in the contributor list of https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action that is a community driven project already attracting new contributors from India and Africa
Another positive example ifor contributions is the YouTube tutorial series for our Python SDK that has been crteated by a community member: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6uVtTx-oqY8V-HBfenONJrsA0Z8xJymX
