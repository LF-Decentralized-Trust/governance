## Project Health

Although Solang's [LFX Insights Dashboard](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-decentralized-trust/overview/github?project=solang&routedFrom=Github&bestPractice=false) shows a decrease in activity, the project is on track to support Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform.

Solang is getting contributions from Stellar developers, since Solang was showcased at Stellar Meridian 2024 Q4.

## Maintainer Diversity

The [maintainers](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) of Solang have not changed since the last review. The project has 4 maintainers: The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the Solana Foundation and Parity Technologies. It is important to note that maintainer activity from Solana Foundation and Parity Technologies has decreased, while SDF's activity has increased.

## Project Adoption

Porject adoption was a major challenge in 2024. After discussions with the maintainers and SDF, we decided to foucs on a [web IDE for Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang-playground), whereby users can write and test smart contracts in a web browser. We are planning to launch the IDE and Solang to the Stellar community in Q3 2025.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

Last yearâ€™s [goal](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/blob/gh-pages/project-reports/2024/2024-annual-Hyperledger-Solang.md#goals) was to making Solang more attractive to developers. We have focused on a visually appealing web IDE, which is a major step towards this goal. The IDE will be launched in Q3 2025.

### Next Year's Goals

Next year's goals are to launch the web IDE and Solang compiler to the Stellar community in Q3 2025. We are also planning to host a hackathon in Q4 2025, where developers can use Solang and the web IDE to build smart contracts for Stellar's Soroban platform.

### Help Required

We are looking for help to improve our docs. Soldity for Stellar includes a lot of new features that are not available in Solidity. We need help to document these features and how to use them.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

As last year, we would recommend Solang to stay in the incubation phase until its sidecar tools (Solang Playground and Solang-Aqd) have reached maturation.
