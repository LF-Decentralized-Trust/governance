## Project Health

Hyperledger Iroha 2 has reached a significant milestone with the release of its MVP Core, 
alongside MVP SDKs for JavaScript and Python. The project continues to gain traction, 
with Iroha 2 MVP (Java) receiving approval for real-world deployment in the Palau Invest and Solomon Islands CBDC projects. 
While email communications and Discord updates have been temporarily paused, we anticipate resuming them soon. 
Meanwhile, real-time support remains active in our <a href="https://t.me/hyperledgeriroha">Telegram channel</a>. Looking ahead, 
we are planning several major enhancements, including a transaction fees module, a hub chain, and an upgraded network runtime.

## Project Adoption

After Iroha 2 is released, we expect more maintainers to join the project, as the mature Iroha 2 codebase would be more beneficial to new projects.
Since joining the Hyperledger Foundation, Iroha 2 has been adopted in multiple real-world applications, demonstrating its reliability and flexibility. Among its key adopters, the latest is the <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/palauinvest">Palau Invest project</a>, a blockchain-based savings bond system developed in collaboration with Soramitsu. This initiative enables Palauan citizens to invest in their country's infrastructure projects—such as roads, bridges, and public facilities—through digital savings bonds, providing both economic benefits and investment opportunities. The system ensures transparency and accessibility by allowing citizens to purchase bonds conveniently via a mobile app.
Prior to Palau Invest, Iroha 2 has been successfully integrated into other projects, showcasing its versatility in financial and enterprise use cases. With its secure, efficient, and scalable architecture, Iroha 2 continues to be a strong choice for digital asset management and financial infrastructure. The successful deployment of the Palau Invest prototype further reinforces its potential in national-scale financial applications, setting a strong foundation for future blockchain-driven economic initiatives.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

We are proud to announce the successful delivery of the Hyperledger Iroha 2.0 MVP release, marking a major milestone in the project's development. This achievement reflects our commitment to providing a robust, secure, and scalable blockchain framework suitable for real-world applications. The MVP introduces significant enhancements, ensuring improved performance, flexibility, and security.
The Iroha 2.0 MVP includes the following key features:
- New Sumeragi Consensus Algorithm – Capable of handling up to 33% Byzantine-faulty nodes, improving system resilience.
- Customizable Fungible and Non-Fungible Assets – Expanding Iroha 2’s utility across various financial and enterprise applications.
- Rich Query DSL – Advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination for more efficient data retrieval.
- Triggers for Deferred Execution – Enabling automation of complex logic through delayed execution.
- Multi-Signature Transactions via Triggers – Enhancing security and collaboration in transaction approval.
- Granular Permissions and Role-Based Access Control – Providing fine-tuned security mechanisms for managing user privileges.
- Support for Custom Executors, Instructions, and Data Models – Allowing users to extend Iroha’s functionality to suit their specific needs.
- First-Class SDK Support – Native SDKs for Rust, Python, Java/Kotlin, and JavaScript, enabling seamless integration into diverse development environments.
- Command-Line Client Interface – Facilitating direct interaction with Iroha peers for improved usability and management.

The completion of the MVP marks a crucial step in the evolution of Iroha 2, laying the foundation for further enhancements, including the transition toward public blockchain capabilities and additional configurable features. As we move forward, we remain committed to improving performance, expanding adoption, and refining the platform to meet the needs of our growing community.

### Next Year's Goals

Building on our progress, our primary goal for the coming year is to enhance Iroha 2’s real-world usability by introducing a configurable transaction fees module. This feature will provide greater flexibility for adopters, making Iroha 2 more adaptable across diverse use cases, from enterprise applications to financial ecosystems. By allowing for customizable fee structures, we aim to improve the economic viability of transactions while maintaining the efficiency and security that Iroha 2 is known for.
In addition, we are actively working on the development of a hubchain, a crucial step in transitioning Iroha 2 towards functioning as a public blockchain. This transition will require a fundamental rework of our consensus mechanism to ensure it meets the demands of a decentralized, public network. Our focus will be on optimizing scalability, security, and performance while maintaining the simplicity and robustness that make Iroha 2 unique. These advancements will position Iroha 2 as a powerful blockchain solution capable of supporting a wide range of applications, from regulated financial environments to broader decentralized ecosystems.
engaged in dialogue with those users to benchmark Iroha and expand its use scope.
We are also excited about the opportunity to participate in the Hyperledger <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq">AI FAQ</a> project and contribute our documentation.


### Help Required

LF Decentralized Trust can help promote the Iroha 2 project within the LF Decentralized Trust community.

## Project Lifecycle Status Recommendation

Graduated status still makes sense for Hyperledger Iroha.
