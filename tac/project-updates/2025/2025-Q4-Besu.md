# 2025 Q4 Besu

## Project Health

Besu completed implementation of the Fusaka hardfork and related protocol upgrades during Q4 2025. This quarter continued making further progress on performance optimisation and syncing performance.

### Major Accomplishments This Quarter

**Fusaka Hardfork**: Final Besu mainnet release with fork times scheduled for mainnet for Osaka, BPO1 and BPO2. Increased Ethereum mainnet gas limit from 36M to 60M per EIP-7935. Testnet support released in September and October with validation on Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi.

**Glamsterdam Protocol Development**: Ongoing implementation work for the next Ethereum network upgrade with multiple merged PRs focused on EIP-7928 Block Access Lists (BAL).

**Tech Debt**: Continued removal of POW from Besu. Removed PoW-specific RPC methods and CLI options as breaking changes. Removed PoW tests and JSON block importer support, added Clique mining deprecation messaging, and announced sunsetting of PoW consensus, Clique block production, and Fast Sync features.

**Performance Optimizations**: EQ opcode optimization, MOD-related opcode performance enhancements, EcRecover precompile and CallDataCopy optimizations, 5-6x faster toFastHex calculation for engine_getBlobsV2, engine_getPayload* method optimizations and Java 25 optimized VM options in startup scripts.

**History Expiry**: Implemented ERA1 file export functionality, complementing existing import capabilities for historical chain data archival and supporting Ethereum's history expiry roadmap.

### Quarterly Release Summary

During Q4 2025, the Besu project released:

- *Besu 25.10.0* (October): Fusaka testnet support, PeerDAS dependency updates, and EVM opcode performance improvements
- *Besu 25.11.0* (November): Mainnet release for Fusaka with Osaka/BPO fork scheduling and 60M gas limit increase
- *Besu 25.12.0* (December): Optimisation of engine RPC blobs API, experimental callTracer tracer option in debug_trace RPCs, transaction receipt encoding fix for eth/69

Mainnet operators were required to upgrade to 25.11.0 before the December 3 deadline.

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

### Community Engagement

**GitHub Activity**: The Besu repository has 237 contributors and 1,737 stars. Q4 saw 207 commits merged from 28 unique contributors, with 68 new issues opened during the quarter addressing Fusaka upgrade challenges, bug reports, and feature requests. The quarter welcomed 12 first-time contributors working on performance improvements and bug fixes.

**Discord and Support Channels**: The Besu community had strong engagement throughout Q4, particularly around performance improvements, protocol development especially Block Access Lists, and Glamsterdam fork discussions.

**Cross-Client Collaboration**: Active engagement in Ethereum All Core Devs (ACDC) calls throughout Q4, coordinating Fusaka development with other execution clients.

**Documentation and Developer Experience**: New CLI options were documented for ethstats reporting, plugin transaction selection, transaction pool balance checking, and snap sync configuration. Documentation was added for new RPC methods and Linea named network support. Deprecation notices were published for Clique block production, Holesky/Mordor/ETC Classic networks, and PoW-specific features, with corresponding removal of deprecated PoW RPC methods and miner CLI options from documentation.

### Technical Development

**Protocol Implementation**: Focus on Ethereum protocol upgrades with 207 commits in Q4:
- EIP-7928 (Block Access Lists): Implementation with 33+ merged PRs covering parallel world state root hash calculation, nonce encoding fixes, CALL recipient inclusion logic, and BAL-based state root computation
- EIP-7935 (Gas Limit Increase): Raised mainnet gas limit from 36M to 60M
- Fusaka hardfork: Support for Osaka, BPO1, and BPO2 fork scheduling on mainnet (December 3) and testnets (Holesky, Sepolia, Hoodi)

## Maintainer Diversity

Maintainer diversity held steady in Q4 with 21 active maintainers, consistent with the previous quarter::

- Consensys: ~19 maintainers (~90%)
- Kaleido: 1 maintainer (~5%)
- Unknown: 1 maintainer (~5%)

Organizational diversity among maintainers continues as a challenge.

Contributors beyond the core maintainer group include:
- **Cross-client developers**: Contributors from Ethereum Foundation and other client teams focused on differential fuzzing, evmtool testing, cross-client compatibility, and EIP-7928 Block Access Lists implementation
- Performance optimization contributors: Contributions from quadratic-labs on MOD opcode optimizations
- Enterprise users: Bug fixes and feature enhancements from organizations deploying private networks
- Individual developers: 12 first-time contributors in Q4 working on performance improvements and bug fixes

### Maintainer Growth

The project continues efforts to add new maintainers from organizations building both public and private networks, focusing on contributors who demonstrate consistent engagement and technical expertise.

## Project Adoption and Usage

### Public Network Usage

Besu holds approximately 16% of mainnet execution layer stake maintaining its critical role in Ethereum's client diversity. Besu is the third most popular Ethereum execution client behind Geth and Nethermind.

**Institutional Confidence**: Major staking providers maintain Besu deployments within their multi-client infrastructure, strengthening network resilience.

### Enterprise and Private Networks

**Financial Services**: Adoption in financial services continues, with institutions leveraging Besu's QBFT consensus and enterprise features.

**Layer 2 Integration**: Presence in Layer 2 scaling solutions, with Besu serving as execution layer infrastructure for rollup projects including Linea. Development of plugin APIs to support additional Layer 2 implementations.

**Private Networks**: Adoption for permissioned networks leveraging QBFT consensus.
