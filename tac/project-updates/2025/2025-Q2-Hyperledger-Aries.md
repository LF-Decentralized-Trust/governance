## Project Health

Although many of the projects that started in Hyperledger Aries continue at a great pace at the [OpenWallet Foundation], with this report the [Hyperledger Aries] project itself can be marked as Archived.

In the last quarter, all of the remaining LFDT Aries GitHub repositories have been "handled" -- moved or archived as appropriate. Some of the repositories were moved into LFDT Labs ([list](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs?q=aries&type=all&language=&sort=)).

I would recommend that the while many of the Aries Discord channels can be removed, we should retain a few of them while they continue to be active or to the end of the year, whichever is longer. Channels to keep are:

- aries
- aries-cloudagent-python
- aries-vcx
- aries-rfcs
- aries-framework-kotlin (now a Labs project)
- aries-framework-swift (now a Labs project)

It would be nice to see the LFDT website Aries project page updated (not deleted) to point to the new homes of the sub-projects on [OpenWallet Foundation] ([Credo-TS], [ACA-Py], [VCX]) and to the [Aries RFCs] at [Decentralized Identity Foundation]. That would encourage those discovering Aries via old links to continue on to find the (very) active projects that started in Aries.
