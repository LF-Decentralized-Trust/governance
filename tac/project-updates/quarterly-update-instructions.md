# Quarterly Review Instructions
Create a file in the `tac/project-updates` subdirectory for the current year and name the file `YYYY-Qn-Project-Name.md` (e.g., `2023-Q1-Hyperledger-Iroha.md`).  Update the `mkdocs.yml` document in the root directory to include the file in the `nav` section under the appropriate year and quarter. If the year or quarter does not yet exist, please add it to match what you see in the `Project Updates` section.

# What Should the Quarterly Review Contain
Quarterly reviews are intended to look at the past quarter to see how the project is progressing against its goals. The allow for a wide audience to better understand the project's health. 

The quarterly review should answer the following questions:

- How are you progressing against your yearly goals?
- What deliverables/outputs did you have in the past quarter?
- What are your goals for the next quarter?
- Do you need any help?
- Changes to maintainer/contributor diversity

# What Should the TAC Evaluate
In general, the TAC will be looking at the health of the project overall and if it is in the correct lifecycle stage. The following is what the TAC will specifically look for:

- Whether all requirements specified in the [LF Decentralized Trust TAC governance](../governing-documents/index.md) met
- Signs of consistent or increasing contribution activity.
- Whether the questions on Discord are being answered in a timely manner.
- Whether PRs and issues on GitHub are being resolved in a timely manner.
- Whether deliverable are being created (e.g., releases or standards updates)
- Understanding the diversity of maintainers in terms of organizations participating and whether the number of active maintainers has increased or decreased over the past year. Ensure your MAINTAINERS.md file is up-to-date.
- Understanding the adoption of the project and how that has changed since the last review or since being accepted into LF Decentralized Trust. Ensure your ADOPTERS.md file is up-to-date.
- Understanding how the project has performed against the goals set in the annual review. If you have not achieved the goals that you set out, that is okay. Feel free to include updates to your goals if things have changed. The TAC should look at what has been accomplished and what challenges the project had in meeting the goals. Ensure your ROADMAP.md file is up-to-date.

# What is the Outcome of the Review
The TAC will approve and merge the pull request or request changes be made to the PR prior to approval and merge.
