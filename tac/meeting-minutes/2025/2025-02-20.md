![All are Welcome in the LF Decentralized Trust Community](../images/all-are-welcome.png "All are Welcome in the LF Decentralized Trust Community")

Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust is committed to creating a safe and welcoming community for all. For more information please visit our Code of Conduct: [LF Decentralized Trust Code of Conduct](../../governing-documents/code-of-conduct.md).

# Announcements
- The [LF Decentralized Trust /dev/weekly developer newsletter](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DR/pages/17170445/dev+weekly+Newsletter) goes out each Friday to hundreds of LF Decentralized Trust developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please [leave a comment for consideration on the upcoming newsletter wiki page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DR/pages/75268141/2025).
- The annual LFDT mentorship program is now accepting project proposals from people who are looking to mentor people who want to work on your project or lab.  This is a great opportunity to bring more contributors into the community who can help you.  Submissions for project proposals are now open and will close on March 15.  Note that the submission form has been moved from Confluence to Github so this will look different for people who have submitted proposals in the past.  You can submit project proposals at: [LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/new?template=mentorship-project.yml)
