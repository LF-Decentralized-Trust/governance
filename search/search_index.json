A good landing page I believe is essential. From this page, users or potential contributors can branch off to particular repositories for deep dives. Also, having a central location where maintainers' lists and contributors' guidelines are maintained would be good (for everybody's reference). Here, the <code>governance</code> repository may be a suitable location. - There are ways to run standards projects on GitHub (as I've discovered in the past few years as part of an IETF Working Group). This might be more sustainable in the long run and also allows chronological record maintenance of conversations and files over a long term. It'll also make the project more amenable to assessments using LF tools, just like other LFDT projects. So I'd encourage the ToIP maintainers to consider exploring this option. - I just wanted to inquire: if there are any code project spinoffs from the reference specifications produced within ToIP, will they be maintained in LFDT-managed GitHub repositories?</p>"},{"location":"project-updates/2025/2025-annual-Web3j/","title":"2025 Annual Review Web3j","text":""},{"location":"project-updates/2025/2025-annual-Web3j/#project-health","title":"Project Health","text":"<p>LF Decentralized Trust Web3j LFX Insights Dashboard</p> <p>The project is relatively new to the LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem.
