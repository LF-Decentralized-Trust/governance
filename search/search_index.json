At the same time, we continue to observe consistent community engagement through GitHub Issues and Discussions.</p> <p>Following the recent approval of updated roles and groups guidelines by the TSC, and their subsequent adoption by the community, we are encouraging teams to review their structures and consider promoting additional committers and maintainers where appropriate. These guidelines provide a clear framework for aligning with best practices, allowing teams to assess their current processes and make informed improvements.

While we've mostly finished this transition, we've initiated the process of refactoring the code to a more vendor-agnostic and unbranded architecture. Our main focus is our SDKs in addition to discussing workflows, roadmaps, and patterns. Information and current state on the transition from Hedera can be found here. Information about our work on making the SDKs vendor neutral can be found here.</p> <p>With all of this work in progress, we plan to release the initial minor versions of all projects in the near future. Next, we plan a major release that will contain all the work from moving the code to a more vendor neutral release.</p> <p>Another main goal is the onboarding of community projects from the Hiero ecosystem. At the moment, we moved 3 community projects to Hiero and a new proposal is in the pipeline. Information about the onboarding of new projects can be found here.</p> <p>On the project's management front, the team is focusing on evaluating and analyzing key project health metrics that track our progress in fostering a thriving and diverse community. These metrics enable us to assess the project's performance by measuring contributions, code velocity, and issue response and resolution times.</p> <p>In hiero-ledger we rely on meassuring tools like LFX Insights, Bitergia and GitHub Insights. With the help of Bitergia, we are able to visualize in detail the contributions data for all the work that happened by the Hedera team before September 2024 (which is when the projects started transitioning to Hiero in hiero-ledger GitHub Organization). LFX Insights helps us confirm the contribution statistics for the work that is happening as we continue to move forward in the projects. Other statistics like GH Insights helps us confirm the data in a specific repository at a time whenever we need to direct focus to a particular component. Leveraging all these metrics tools helps us staying accurate and caught up with the fast pace at which the repos continue to transition into https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.

We anticipate continued growth in our community's diversity, enabling the adoption of more community-driven components.</p> <p>The project is expected:</p> <ul> <li>Grow their TSC - Following the recent elections, we anticipate increased participation from members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This growth will enable more companies to take an active role in shaping the project and contribute to the continued expansion of our community.</li> <li>Grow their maintainers and committers - We are actively encouraging participation from new contributors and raising awareness among current maintainers and committers to review their contributions in accordance with our project guidelines. The goal is to identify and nominate qualified individuals for committer roles. Simultaneously, we are supporting projects in assessing their current resources to identify opportunities for promoting existing committers to maintainer roles, aligned with the newly established criteria.</li> <li>Recruit more participating companies - As we continue to analyze our contributor metrics, we remain committed to promoting Hiero through events, seminars, and forums to enhance the project's visibility. Our goal is to attract interest from a broader range of companies willing to participate and contribute to the project's objectives. Through these efforts, we aim to increase both the diversity and reach of our community.</li> </ul> <p>Our vendor-neutral releases will provide the project with enhanced flexibility and adaptability, supporting its long-term success.</p> <p>As a project, we anticipate continued progress in the following areas for Hiero:</p> <ul> <li>Reliability - We remain committed to continue growing our community engagement by encouraging contributions to support both our current and upcoming SDKs, as well as helping to build a more comprehensive Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) with richer test coverage to ensure robust end-to-end validation of our software implementation in our SDKs. We continue to review and adhere to our security policies, staying informed about potential threats and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in our codebase. Additionally, we promote active participation in our security efforts by offering bounty opportunities to encourage contributions in this critical area.</li> <li>Scalability - The team continuously evaluates opportunities for collaboration with other LFDT projects. We remain actively informed about the focus areas of these projects to identify potential synergies where Hiero can contribute and collaborate effectively. At the same time, we are focused on acquiring new adopters, end users and chair members.</li> <li>Performance - Additionally, we are focused on achieving faster finality, lower latency, and continuously increasing capacity to support larger transactions.

Documentation repo's were updated to include instructions for building networks based on the Ubuntu 20.04 codebase with the latest update being done in March, 2024.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Continue to support the migration of Indy clients away from the Indy SDK.<ul> <li>Update the Indy documentation to point people to current \u201cbest practices\u201d.</li> <li>Update and release the Indy VDR component as needed.</li> <li>STATUS: Completed. Indy documentation and all Discord and other community communications all point people away from the deprecated Indy SDK and towards its replacements.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Address the \u201cCorporate Firewall\u201d issue, where users behind a corporate firewall cannot access an Indy network because of the ZMQ ports being used.<ul> <li>STATUS: Partially Completed. Several implementers (teams in Brazil and Canada) implemented \"one-off\" solutions to this using a local instance of an \"indy-proxy\". A Hyperledger Mentorship Program Project called \"Indy Read Replica\" (repository) implements a more general approach, allowing anyone to run a component that is configured to retrieve and server Indy transactions from multiple networks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Evolve Indy so as to be ready for when the current implementation will need more functionality, such via the Indy on Besu approach.</li> <li>STATUS: In Progress. Excellent progress has been made on Indy on Besu, and the work on the project continues. See the recent Indy on Besu article for details about the progress, and additional updates below.</li> </ul> <p>Desired functionality:</p> <ul> <li>Ledger Redactibility (aka \"tombstoning\" transactions)</li> <li>Simplify the process for adding more types of transactions so that new object types can be published on the ledger with some verification. Currently, that requires more work than we would like, so it does not happen as often as we would need.<ul> <li>Simplify, but ideally without increasing the risk of \"bad data\" going on the ledger and requiring use of the \"Ledger Redactibility\" feature (e.g. permissioned writing, and at least some structural verification of the data)</li> <li>With more types of transactions we can more easily transition to new of kinds of verifiable credentials, such as AnonCreds v2.</li> <li>With transitions to new VC formats, we get better functionality, such as much better revocation \u2014 which will reduce the number of transactions on the ledger \u2014 reducing the pressure on scalability.<ul> <li>Scalability is not an issue today, but will be some day.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Additional DIDDoc support, such support for additional key types</li> <li>Read replicas for performance</li> <li>Storing other document types on an Indy ledger, such as OCA Bundles</li> </ul> <p>Beyond the \"Read Replica\" work referenced earlier in this report, little progress was made on the desired functionality. Teams are focused on deployments with what is available.  </p> <p>Indy on Besu:</p> <ul> <li>Transitioning from the existing PoC and design to a concrete implementation.</li> <li>Improvement of existing modules</li> <li>Integration with Aries Frameworks</li> <li>Implementation of migration tools</li> <li>Some of the general desired functionality above might be done in the Indy on Besu implementation.</li> </ul> <p>STATUS: Great progress on this was accomplished in 2024. Large companies have started making significant contributions to the codebase, and the community has expanded considerably. The smooth integration of Indy on Besu into production networks is underway. The next year will bring us statistical data on the productivity of this system in real projects.</p>"},{"location":"project-updates/2025/2025-annual-Hyperledger-Indy/#next-years-goals","title":"Next Year's Goals","text":"<p>Here is a list of goals we intend to work towards during the coming year to help maintain and enhance the Hyperledger Indy project:</p> <ol> <li>Complete the Indy-node upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04</li> <li>Begin work on the Indy-node upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04</li> <li>Increase OpenSSF Scorecard rating     a.

A good landing page I believe is essential. From this page, users or potential contributors can branch off to particular repositories for deep dives. Also, having a central location where maintainers' lists and contributors' guidelines are maintained would be good (for everybody's reference). Here, the <code>governance</code> repository may be a suitable location. - There are ways to run standards projects on GitHub (as I've discovered in the past few years as part of an IETF Working Group). This might be more sustainable in the long run and also allows chronological record maintenance of conversations and files over a long term. It'll also make the project more amenable to assessments using LF tools, just like other LFDT projects. So I'd encourage the ToIP maintainers to consider exploring this option. - I just wanted to inquire: if there are any code project spinoffs from the reference specifications produced within ToIP, will they be maintained in LFDT-managed GitHub repositories?</p>"},{"location":"project-updates/2025/2025-annual-Web3j/","title":"2025 Annual Review Web3j","text":""},{"location":"project-updates/2025/2025-annual-Web3j/#project-health","title":"Project Health","text":"<p>LF Decentralized Trust Web3j LFX Insights Dashboard</p> <p>The project is relatively new to the LF Decentralized Trust Ecosystem.
